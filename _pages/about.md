I am a college student with a strong English background, majoring in Artificial Intelligence at [Macau Polytechnic University ](https://www.mpu.edu.mo), seeking a summer internship to gain practical knowledge in the science and technology industry, which aligns with my passion. Previously, I had completed a two-year senior high school Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) track to gain valuable knowledge and insights in this field.

About me
======
My name is Lee Kit Ieng 李潔瀅, my nickname is Sophia, and currently majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Macau Polytechnic University. I am also part of the English Debate Team in MPU, entered as a rookie with curiosity. I graduated from Ateneo Senior High School under the STEM strand with first honors and joined many extracurricular activities to explore new interests and meet new people. I held the Public Relations Officer position in one of the organizations for two years. With my team, we were able to collaborate on projects with internal and external organizations. During these two years, I was a student-athlete, a member of the Basketball Team, so dealing with hectic schedules isn’t new to me. I’ve also volunteered in batch projects such as fair day committees and promenade internal members. During this period, I also joined math competitions to showcase my interest in the STEM field.

I am passionate about artificial intelligence because of its impact on our world—a tool and a threat. While it helps humans with tasks, humans’ increasing reliance on it is also a threat to our society. To prevent this negative outcome, it is important to understand and use AI responsibly to achieve greater outcomes, and that's why I am deeply passionate about Artificial Intelligence, because it requires strategies to achieve the desired outcome effectively. As a student, I only have limited theoretical and practical knowledge in this field, and my goal is to one day recreate AI models that could positively shape the world.
